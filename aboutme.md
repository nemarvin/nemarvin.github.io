title: "About Me"

---
I am an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. I teach courses on world history and research methods, as well as seminars on: France and the World through Film, Revolution in World History, and the Haitian Revolution in Global Perspective. Students in my classes learn how power shapes history and what we know about it. 

I also tell stories. I write about race, slavery, and resistance in the French colonial world. Right now, I'm working on a book that explores how gender and family dynamics shaped the politics of race on the Indian Ocean island of RÃ©union, from its seventeenth-century establishment to the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project examines the role of the Catholic Church in the making and maintaining of slavery in the French empire.
