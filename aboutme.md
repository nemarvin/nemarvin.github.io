Nathan Marvin is an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where he is also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. His work examines slavery and resistance in the French colonial world. His current book project explores the shifting politics of race in France’s Indian Ocean colonies during the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. His ongoing second project explores the lived experiences of people enslaved on properties of Catholic orders and congregations throughout the French empire. He teaches courses on World History Since 1500, Historical Methods, Modern France and the World, History of the Atlantic World, and the Haitian Revolution in Global Perspective. Through collaborative interpretation of archival sources, students in his classes mine stories from history’s margins in order to understand how power shapes both past and present. Originally from the Piscataqua Region of New Hampshire, Nate lives and works in Little Rock, Arkansas.
