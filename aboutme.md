I’m a historian of the French colonial world, focusing on race, slavery, and religion. My first book examines the politics of race on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion during the age of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project investigates how Catholic orders and congregations shaped the French colonial slave system—and how enslaved people resisted on Church-run plantations. 

I live in beautiful Central Arkansas, where I teach history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Teaching is my main passion, especially when I get to work with students to dig into how the past informs present-day questions of justice and power. I try to spend as much time as I can in the archives—in France, Réunion Island, and Mauritius, and back home in the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire.<p>
