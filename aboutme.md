---
I am an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. I teach courses on world history and research methods, as well as seminars on the Haitian Revolution in World History, Modern France through Film, and the Atlantic in Global Perspective.

I write about race and religion in the French colonial world. Right now, I'm working on a book that examines how gender and family dynamics shaped the politics of whiteness on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion, from its seventeenth-century establishment to the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project is a history of slavery and resistance on properties held by French Catholic priests and nuns, from Montreal to Mauritius.
