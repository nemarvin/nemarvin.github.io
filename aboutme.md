title: "About Me"
---

I am a cultural and social historian of the French colonial world, focusing primarily on race-making, slavery, and resistance in the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius and Réunion. I teach history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. In addition to surveys on world history from 1500, I regularly teach historical methods (graduate and undergrad) and have designed seminar courses entitled the Haitian Revolution in World History, Modern France in Film, Global Perspectives on Race, Revolutions in World History, and Atlantic World (and Beyond!).

My current book manuscript examines the politics of whiteness on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion, from its seventeenth-century establishment to the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project is a history of slavery and resistance on properties held by French Catholic priests and nuns, from Montreal to Mauritius. 

I am originally from the Piscataqua Region of New England. I live and work in Central Arkansas.
