I am a historian of French Creole communities across the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. My work examines how slavery & resistance, race & religion, shaped social life and culture in those regions. My first book traces the politics of race on Réunion Island before and during the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project focuses on the relationships between Catholic missionary clergy and the people they enslaved throughout the French colonial world.

I teach history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.
