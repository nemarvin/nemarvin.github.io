I am an assistant professor of History at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. My work examines race & religion, slavery & resistance in French imperial spaces across the world. My book manuscript, “Bourbon Island Creoles: Race and Revolution in France’s Indian Ocean Colonies,” traces the connectivities between disparate regions of France's colonial empire and their effects on the politics of race in Mauritius and Réunion Island over the course of the long eighteenth century. My second, ongoing project documents the interrelated histories of colonial slavery and the Catholic Church, focusing in particular on the lives of enslaved people rendered “national property” during the French Revolution. I teach courses on world history, historical methods, Modern France and the World, and the Haitian Revolution in Global Perspective. Students in my classes examine how power shapes our past and present, shining light on stories from the margins and "in-between" spaces of the historical record.
