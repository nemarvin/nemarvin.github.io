I teach history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. My research explores the social and cultural history of the French colonial world in the eighteenth century, with a particular focus on race-making. My current book manuscript examines the politics of whiteness on the Indian Ocean island of RÃ©union, from its seventeenth-century establishment to the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project is a study of slavery and resistance on properties held by Catholic priests and nuns throughout France's empire, from Montreal to Mauritius. 

I am originally from the Piscataqua Region of New England. I live and work in Central Arkansas.
