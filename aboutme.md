I am a cultural and social historian of the French colonial world, focusing primarily on race-making in the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius and Réunion. My current book manuscript examines the politics of whiteness on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion, from its seventeenth-century establishment to the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project is a history of slavery and resistance on properties held by Catholic priests and nuns throughout France's eighteenth-century colonial empire, from Montreal to Mauritius. 

I am an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. I teach our world history survey and historical methods courses (graduate and undergrad). I have also designed and led seminars on The Haitian Revolution in World History, Modern France through Film, Global Perspectives on Race, Revolutions in World History, and History of the Atlantic World (and Beyond!).

I am originally from the Piscataqua Region of New England. I live and work in Central Arkansas.
