Nate Marvin is an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where he is also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. His work explores slavery and resistance in the French colonial world, and his current book project examines the shifting politics of race on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion, before and during the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. His ongoing second project explores the lived experiences of people enslaved on properties of Catholic orders and congregations throughout France's colonial empire, from Montreal to Mauritius. He teaches courses on World History From 1500, Historical Methods, Modern France and the World Through Film, History of the Atlantic World, and the Haitian Revolution in Global Perspective. Students in his classes interpret primary sources collaboratively, mining stories from history’s margins to understand how power shapes both past and present. 

Originally from the Piscataqua Region of New Hampshire, Nate lives and works in Arkansas.
