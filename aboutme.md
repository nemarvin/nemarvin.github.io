I am an assistant professor of History at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. My research deals with slavery & resistance in the French colonial world, as well as race, gender, and religious practices among a range of actors touched by empire. My book manuscript, “Bourbon Island Creoles: Race and Revolution in France’s Indian Ocean Colonies,” traces the connectivities between disparate regions of France's global empire in the long eighteenth century and their effects on the politics of race in Mauritius and Réunion Island. My second, ongoing project documents the interrelated histories of colonial slavery and the Catholic Church, focusing in particular on the lives of people enslaved on ecclesiastical properties in the French empire. I teach courses on World History since 1500, historical methods, Modern France, and the Haitian Revolution in Global Perspective. Students in my classes learn to investigate how power shapes our past and present, illuminating stories from the margins of the historical record through a combination of original research and collaborative interpretation of archival materials.
