I am a cultural and social historian of the eighteenth-century French colonial world. I'm working on a book that examines how gender and family dynamics shaped the politics of whiteness on the Indian Ocean island of RÃ©union, from its seventeenth-century establishment to the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project is a history of slavery and resistance on properties held by French Catholic priests and nuns, from Montreal to Mauritius.

I teach history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. I offer courses on world history and research methods, as well as seminars on the Haitian Revolution, Modern France through Film, Global Perspectives on Race, and Revolutions in World History.

I am originally from the Piscataqua Region of New England. I live and work in Central Arkansas.
