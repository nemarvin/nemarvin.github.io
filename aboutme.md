I am an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. My research deals with slavery & resistance in the French colonial world, as well as questions of race, gender, and religious practice. My current book project examines the makings of racial categories on Mauritius and RÃ©union Island in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth centuries. I am also working on a project that explores the lives of people enslaved on properties of the Catholic Church across the French empire and beyond. I teach courses on world history since 1500, historical methods, Modern France and the World, and the Haitian Revolution in Global Perspective. Students in my classes investigate how power shapes our past and present, excavating stories from the margins of the historical record through a combination of original research and collaborative interpretation of primary source materials. 

I hail from the Piscataqua region on the border between Maine and New Hampshire. I live and work in Little Rock, Arkansas.
