title: "About Me"

---
I am an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. I'm interested in the histories of slavery and resistance in the French colonial world, which I explore in comparative perspective between Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions. My current book project examines how global dynamics influenced the politics of race on the island Réunion, from its seventeenth-century founding as a satellite of a French outpost in Madagascar to the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project is a study of the role of the Catholic Church in the making and maintaining of slavery in the French empire. 

I teach courses on World History, Atlantic History, Historical Methods, France and the World through Film, and the Haitian Revolution in Global Perspective. Students in my classes interpret primary sources collaboratively, mining stories from history’s margins to understand how power shapes both past and present.
