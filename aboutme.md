I am an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. My research deals with race and religion, slavery and resistance, in French imperial spaces across the world. My book manuscript, “Bourbon Island Creoles: Race and Revolution in France’s Indian Ocean Colonies,” traces the connectivities between disparate regions of France's colonial empire and their effects on the politics of race in Mauritius and Réunion Island, especially during the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second, ongoing project documents the interrelated histories of colonial slavery and the Catholic Church, focusing in particular on the lives of enslaved people rendered “national property” as a result of the French Revolution. The classes I teach examine how power shapes our past and present,  shining light on stories from the margins and "in-between" spaces of the historical record. I encourage students to do the same, whether in my world history surveys, methods courses, or graduate seminars.
