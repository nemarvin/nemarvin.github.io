title: "About Me"
---

I am a social and cultural historian of the early modern French colonial world. My current book project examines the shifting politics of race on the Indian Ocean island of RÃ©union, before and during the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My other project-in-progress examines how and why corporate entities of the Catholic Church became major practitioners of slavery in the French empire. It also sheds light on the identities and experiences of those enslaved by the Church across the French Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. I teach history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member.

I am originally from the Piscataqua Region of New England. I live and work in Central Arkansas.
