I am an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. I focus on slavery & resistance in the French colonial world. My current book project examines the makings of racial categories on Mauritius and RÃ©union Island (17th-19th centuries). My second project explores the lived experiences of people enslaved on properties owned or managed by Catholic orders and congregations throughout the French empire. I teach courses on World History Since 1500, Historical Methods, Modern France and the World, History of the Atlantic World, and the Haitian Revolution in Global Perspective. Students in my classes investigate how power shapes our past and present, excavating stories from history's margins through a mix of original research and collaborative interpretation of primary sources. 

I live and work in Little Rock, Arkansas. I am originally from New Hampshire.
