title: "About Me"

---
I am an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. My work explores slavery and resistance in the French colonial world, and my current book project examines the shifting politics of race on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion, before and during the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. The other project I'm working on is about the role of the Catholic Church in the making and maintaining of slavery in the French colonial world. 

I teach courses on World History From 1500, Historical Methods, France and the World, and the Haitian Revolution in Global Perspective. Students in my classes interpret primary sources collaboratively, mining stories from history’s margins to understand how power shapes both past and present.
