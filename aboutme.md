    I am a cultural and social historian interested in race & religion, slavery & resistance throughout the French colonial world. I teach history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. In addition to my survey courses on world history, I offer seminars on historical research & digital methods, the Haitian Revolution, Modern France through Film, Global Perspectives on Race, and Revolutions in World History.

    My current book manuscript examines the politics of whiteness on the Indian Ocean island of RÃ©union, from its seventeenth-century establishment to the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project is a history of slavery and resistance on properties held by French Catholic priests and nuns, from Montreal to Mauritius.

    I am originally from the Piscataqua Region of New England. I live and work in Central Arkansas.
