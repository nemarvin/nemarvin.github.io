I am a historian of the French Creole world in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. My work explores how slavery & resistance, race & religion, shaped life and social relations in spaces across that world.

My first book traces developments in the politics of race on Réunion Island before and during the era of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project explores the complicated dynamics between Catholic missionary clergy and the people they enslaved throughout the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds.

I teach history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.
