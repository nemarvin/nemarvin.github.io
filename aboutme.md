I’m a historian of the French colonial world, focusing on race, slavery, and religion. My first book examines the politics of race on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion during the age of the French and Haitian Revolutions. My second project investigates how Catholic orders and congregations shaped the French colonial slave system—and how enslaved people resisted on Church-run plantations. I teach history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. I’m passionate about helping students work together to understand history’s relevance in our lives and connect the past to present-day questions of justice and power.
