I am an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, where I am also a Gender Studies affiliate faculty member. I specialize in slavery & resistance in the French colonial world. My current book project examines the makings of racial categories on Mauritius and RÃ©union Island (17th-19th centuries). My second project explores the lives of people enslaved on properties managed by Catholic orders and congregations throughout the French empire. The courses I teach include: World History Since 1500, Historical Methods, Modern France and the World, History of the Atlantic World, and the Haitian Revolution in Global Perspective. Students in my classes investigate how power shapes our past and present, excavating stories from the margins of the historical record through a mix of original research and collaborative interpretation of primary source materials. 

I come from the Piscataqua region, on the border between Maine and New Hampshire. I live and work in Little Rock, Arkansas.
