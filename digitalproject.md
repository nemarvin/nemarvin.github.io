What happens when we center the experiences of the enslaved, rather than their enslavers, in telling stories from the past? “Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic” brings to light a long-buried episode of the French Revolution: the seizure and sale by state agents of hundreds of enslaved adults and children residing on properties of the Catholic Church. It shows how we can read resistance in archives designed to commodify and control. It also includes an atlas of sites of slaveholding by various missionary organizations and a media library about ongoing movements for recognition and redress among descendant communities.
