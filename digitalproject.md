What happens when we center the experiences of the enslaved, rather than their enslavers? “Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic” brings to light a long-buried episode of the French Revolution: the seizure and sale by state agents of hundreds of enslaved adults and children residing on properties of the Catholic Church. This site attempts to tell their stories, showing how we can read resistance even in archives designed to commodify and control. It also includes an atlas of sites of ecclesiastical slaveholding and a library of news resources about movements for recognition and redress among descendant communities.
