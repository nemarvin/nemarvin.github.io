“Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic” is a digital history resource designed for scholars, teachers, and students. It brings to light a long-buried episode of the French Revolution: the seizure and sale by state agents of hundreds of enslaved adults and children residing on properties of the Catholic Church. 

What happens when we center the experiences of the enslaved, rather than those of the priests and politicians who produced the majority of the documentation about them? This site provides the tools to read resistance even in records designed to commodify and control.
