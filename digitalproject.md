“Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic” brings to light a long-buried episode of the Age of Revolution: the seizure and sale by agents of the First French Republic of hundreds of enslaved adults and children residing on properties of the Catholic Church on Réunion Island. The site shows how we can read resistance in archives designed to commodify and control enslaved people, centering their experiences rather than those of enslavers. It also includes a global overview of sites of enslavement by missionary organizations in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, as well as a media resource center for tracking movements for recognition and redress among descendant communities.

"Arkansas Creole" is a digital history project that aims to document the contributions of French-speaking people to early Arkansas history. It explores how the diverse Creole community that lived here—comprising people of European, indigenous, and African descent—shaped the state's culture and geography well after the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. The project features interactive maps, annotated photographs of archival documents, and distillations of recent scholarship that illuminate and contextualize the world of "Creole Arkansas" in all of its richness and complexity.

**French Maritime Connections between Atlantic and Indian Ocean**

"This Unalterable Friendship" ([Link](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f7eb9937a53846c4ab0f1f1812d24a7c)) || "Creoles Far From Our Land" ([Link](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a4727bb429634c28a27c7b217e345419))

Two digital history projects that explore the maritime connections between Mauritius and the Atlantic world during significant historical transitions. The first project, "Creoles Far From Our Land," focuses on J. B. Tabardin, a Mauritian sailor whose early 19th-century memoirs provide insights into the era of the Revolutionary Wars. His accounts offer a unique perspective on the global repercussions of the Atlantic Revolutions, highlighting their impact on Creoles of color and discussing themes of race, national belonging, and masculinity.

The second project, "This Unalterable Friendship," explores the early interactions between American merchants and the French Indian Ocean islands, specifically Mauritius and Réunion. These islands became crucial naval and commercial hubs, with the establishment of a U.S. consulate in Port Louis in 1794 marking a significant development in Franco-American relations. This project examines how the Mascarene Islands served as conduits for goods and news between Asia and the Atlantic, helping American merchants circumvent British trade controls. It also reflects on the broader geopolitical context, including the Haitian Revolution and the 1794 French Abolition Decree, culminating in the 1796 revolt in Mauritius where local elites resisted French abolition efforts with the support of American merchants, who prioritized their economic interests over their professed moral stances.
