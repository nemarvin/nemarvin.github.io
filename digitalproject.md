“Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic” is a digital storytelling project designed for a wide range of users (scholars, teachers, and students). The site helps uncover a long-buried episode of the Age of Revolutions: the seizure and sale by the First French Republic of hundreds of enslaved adults and children held in bondage by Catholic clergy. The site reveals archival evidence of these sales, which occurred with the acceptance of even antislavery politicians. It also offers users a window onto a larger, global phenomenon: the enslavement of thousands of men, women, and children by Catholic corporate entities between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. What happens when we center the experiences of the enslaved rather than the voices of priests and politicians, whose perspectives show up the most in the historical record? Can we discern details about their lives, experiences, families, and even acts of resistance, in the very records designed to facilitate their enslavement?
