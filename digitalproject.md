“Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic” is a digital storytelling project designed for scholars, teachers, and students. It brings to light a long-buried episode of the Age of Revolutions: the seizure and sale by the First French Republic of hundreds of men, women, and children enslaved on properties of the colonial clergy. The website presents tools to interpret archival materials related to these events. It also offers a window onto the global phenomenon of slaveholding by Catholic corporate entities (17th-19th centuries). 

What happens when we center the experiences of the victims of these events, rather than those of priests and politicians? This site aims to demonstrate how we can read resistance even in the records that facilitated their enslavement.
