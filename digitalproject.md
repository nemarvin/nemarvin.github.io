“Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic” brings to light a long-buried episode of the Age of Revolution: the seizure and sale by agents of the First French Republic of hundreds of enslaved adults and children residing on properties of the Catholic Church. The site shows how we can read resistance in archives designed to commodify and control enslaved people, centering their experiences rather than those of enslavers. It also includes a global overview of sites of slaveholding by missionary organizations in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, as well as a media resource center for tracking movements for recognition and redress among descendant communities.
