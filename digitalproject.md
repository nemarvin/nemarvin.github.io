“Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic” is a digital history resource designed for scholars, teachers, and students. It brings to light a long-buried episode of the Age of Revolution: the seizure and sale by the First French Republic of hundreds of enslaved adults and children residing on properties of the Catholic Church in France's colonies. An interactive atlas presents the scope and scale of slaveholding by Catholic corporate entities worldwide (17th-19th centuries). The website also provides tools for interpreting archival materials from sites of ecclesiastical slavery in Haiti and Réunion Island. What happens when we center the experiences of the enslaved, rather than those of the priests and politicians who produced the majority of the documentation about them? This site's narrative sections show how we can read resistance even in records designed to facilitate the commodification and control of human beings.
