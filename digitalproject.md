“Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic” is a digital storytelling project designed for scholars, teachers, and students. It brings to light a long-buried episode of the Age of Revolutions: the seizure and sale by the First French Republic of hundreds of enslaved adults and children held in bondage on properties of the colonial clergy. The website presents users with tools to interpret archival materials related to these events. It also offers users a window onto the broader, global phenomenon of slaveholding by Catholic corporate entities (17th-19th centuries). 

What happens when we center the experiences of the victims of these events, rather than those of priests and politicians? What details can we glean about their identities and perspectives? This site aims to demonstrate how we can read resistance in the very records that facilitated their enslavement.
