“Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic” is a digital storytelling project designed for scholars, teachers, and students. It brings to light a long-buried episode of the Age of Revolutions: the seizure and sale by the First French Republic of hundreds of enslaved adults and children held in bondage by colonial clergy. The site presents users with tools to interpret the archival evidence of these events, which occurred with the acceptance of even antislavery politicians. It also offers users a window onto the larger, global phenomenon of which these elements were a part: the enslavement of thousands of men, women, and children by Catholic corporate entities between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. What happens when we center the experiences of the enslaved rather than those of the priests and politicians whose perspectives dominate the historical record? What details can we glean about their identities, lives, families, and points of view? Can we read resistance in the very records designed to facilitate their continued enslavement?
