Digital History Resources

Prof. Nathan Marvin ~ University of Arkansas at Little Rock

Welcome, historians! This running list contains a mixed bag of links to digital archives, digital history applications, and other history-related media that I’ve been collecting for students over the years. Wait for the content to load, then use your “Find” tool (CTRL+F on PC, Command+F on Mac) to scour this list for topics, people, events, or places that interest you.  Follow the links provided for more information. For the most part, the descriptions are not my own but gleaned from online bulletin boards and announcements. 

Note: “Digital History” is broadly construed here. It includes online archives, articles about digital history, and tools for building your own digital history resources. You’ll note a strong thematic emphasis on slavery and Atlantic world studies, as these are my research fields and, consequently, those of most of my networks. For more about what “Digital History” is, check out this introductory essay: [Stella Brennan, “Digital History” from The Inclusive Historian’s Handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13WudjfBvV1Ph6ucDaRzjbGSvRTGln3nK/view?usp=sharing)

# * * *DIGITIZED PRIMARY SOURCES

Documents, Images, Maps, Curated Research Tools 

**Enslaved.org (and the Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation) (US History, African American History, Atlantic History, Slavery, African Diaspora, Quantitative, Data)** The Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation (ISSN 2691-297X) is a digital academic journal that focuses on publishing data articles about the lives of enslaved Africans from the fifteenth to the early twentieth century. It collaborates with Enslaved.org to make the contributed data discoverable and interactive, while also establishing a sustainable scholarly repository for digital projects related to the history of African slavery. The journal aims to elevate curated data to first-class publication status, providing scholarly review, recognition, and credit to those involved in generating, standardizing, and describing digital records. All datasets published by the journal are preserved in the Harvard Dataverse or other appropriate repositories and made available on Enslaved.org.  <https://jsdp.enslaved.org>

**Two** **Plantations: Enslaved Families in Virginia and Jamaica (US History, African American History, American Slavery, Caribbean, US South)** Slave biographies provide glimpses into the lives of those trapped in forced labor at Mesopotamia and Mount Airy, revealing their limited possibilities for personal achievement. These records, largely controlled by slaveholders and reflecting their biases, can be interpreted against the grain to highlight the inherent personhood, connections, and sense of belonging of the enslaved. This opens up fruitful lines of investigation, exploring the impact of enslaved motherhood through the fortunes of children born into Jamaican and Virginian slavery, the influence of interracial relationships on the concept of family, and the effects of displacement on forced migrants from Virginia to Alabama. Additionally, studying the freedpeople from Mount Airy in the 1870 census offers insights into the first five years of their freedom. These complex inquiries, more valuable than easy answers, contribute to a deeper understanding of slave life, despite the challenges posed by plantation data. Shortly after the [death of Richard Dunn](https://live-sas-www-history.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/emeritus/richard-s-dunn), creator “TwoPlantations,” the site went offline (as of June 2023, only accessible via the Internet Archive:

**Mapping Renewal (Little Rock, Arkansas, Urban Renewal, 20th century)** The Mapping Renewal pilot project focused on creating access and providing context to segregation and urban renewal in the city of Little Rock, Arkansas. Geographic segregation in Little Rock was, in part, the result of urban renewal projects of the kind that swept the nation in the mid-twentieth century. In the 1960s, urban renewal in central Little Rock comprised one of the largest demolition and clearance programs in the country. Instead of reinvigorating the city, these programs, like so many others carried out across the U.S., further promoted segregation and white flight. Mapping Renewal aims to make valuable humanities content widely accessible through digitization and geolocation of a unique compilation of materials that will allow a range of users to integrate the history of Little Rock into larger studies of the twentieth-century American metropolis.

**Rising Above: Rohwer Reconstructed (Arkansas History, Japanese Internment, WWII, American History, Japanese-American History)** “One of ten Japanese-American internment camps established during World War II, the Rohwer Relocation Center in rural Desha County, Arkansas opened on September 18, 1942. At the time of its closure on November 30, 1945, the camp had been home - at one time or another - to 11,926 Japanese-Americans forcibly removed from their homes on the West Coast. Just as their three years of internment left an indelible mark on the landscape of their lives, so they altered the place called Rohwer, both figuratively and literally. Remnants and ruins of the camp still scatter the fields planted in cotton and soybeans, and the Memorial Cemetery, declared a National Historic Monument in 1992, is a somber reminder of the people who lived and worked here. Interpretive panels constructed at the site in 2013 tell the abridged history of the camp, but are by necessity too brief to articulate the immensity of the full narrative. The documents, maps, and visualizations presented here are fragments of that narrative, pieced together in a technological framework, in an effort to bring the story to life.” <https://risingabove.cast.uark.edu/>

**Radical Translations (#FrenchRevolution #AgeOfRevolution #Italy #England #France #Translation #Language #DigitalHumanities #18thCentury #19thCentury)** “This project looks to the French Revolution to recover the vitality of Europe’s shared radical past. In the convulsive political climate of revolution, translation was not simply a new container for an esteemed original. It was also a type of direct action, as revolutionaries and their sympathizers turned to translation to express a commitment to radical ideas that they were not always able to do in practice. This project repositions translators not as passive recipients of foreign propaganda but as key cultural mediators seeking to ‘spread democracy’ into new cultures and different language communities – a contested practice then as now. We define as ‘radical’ any translation that aims to extend democratic and egalitarian ideas into new contexts. This includes both inter-cultural exchange between languages and intra-cultural translation adapted to domestic ends, as the revolutionaries sought to cross all sorts of linguistic, geographic, social and cultural boundaries.”

 **REPAIRS/REPARATIONS (#Slavery #Reparations)** These days we tend to think about reparations as a modern idea. In fact, “reparations” were once granted in massive amounts–not to the enslaved but to slaveowners for their property “lost” after emancipation! This map displays the dates of abolition of slavery and the amounts of “indemnity” payments granted across various countries in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. In addition to these historical data, the site also provides information about movements for reparations to descendants of enslaved people. Site currently (Feb. 2022) only available in French.  <https://esclavages.cnrs.fr/cartographie/>

**Slave Streets, Free Streets: Visualizing the Landscape of Early Baltimore (#UnitedStates #UrbanHistory #GIS #Maps #Slavery #BlackHistory #AfricanAmericanHistory)** is part of the University of Maryland—–Baltimore County IRC’s research on Visualizing Early Baltimore. After creating The BEARINGS of Baltimore, the IRC’s representation of Baltimore circa 1815 there remains a desire to fill these empty streets with the people who lived in them. Slave Streets, Free Streets seeks to bring to life the streets and squares, by focusing on the enslaved and free black workers who populated the city. At this writing, it remains a planned, versus produced project, with funding having been sought from the National Endowment for the Humanities and other sources. The project, should funding be acquired, would be produced as follows.  Slavery was inextricably woven through the fabric of society in Baltimore, shaping the lives of blacks and whites, free and enslaved. Drawing on records such as city directories, tax records, census reports, newspapers, and other historical documents, Slave Streets, Free Streets identifies people, including free and enslaved residents, at locations around the city, tying them by name to specific addresses. Slave advertisements and slave narratives also helped in identifying dozens of places where Baltimoreans were engaged in the slave trade and in telling the stories of fugitives from slavery. This experience is spatially represented in several ways including dot-density maps. Dot-density maps show that Baltimore’s 1820 population (by ward) was relatively integrated, in vivid contrast with the so-called “black butterfly” configuration of racial, social, and economic segregation that become the reality in so many US cities during the Great Migration due to racist practices such as "red-lining." Such segregation is revealed in more recent maps of the city and is with us today. <https://www.irc.umbc.edu/projects/slave-streets>

**#CharlestonSyllabus (Charleston Syllabus) (Race, United States)** is a Twitter movement and crowdsourced syllabus using the hashtag #CharlestonSyllabus to compile a list of reading recommendations relating to the history of racial violence in the United States. It was created in response to the race-motivated violence in Charleston, South Carolina on the evening of June 17, 2015, when Dylann Roof opened fire during a Bible study session at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, killing 9 people. These texts provide information about racial violence in the United States and provide background on the history of race relations in South Carolina in particular and the United States in general. They also offer education on race, racial identities, global white supremacy and black resistance. Several of the suggested readings shed light on race and racism on a global scale.” (Wikipedia article, accessed 9/22/21) Now maintained by the African American Intellectual History Society. <https://www.aaihs.org/resources/charlestonsyllabus/>

**Famn Rebel (Women’s History, Haitian Revolution, Black Atlantic, Black History, 18th-19th century)** ‘Fanm Rebèl’, a Haitian Kreyòl term meaning ‘rebel women’, is a 3-year research project sponsored by the Leverhulme Trust and the Institute for Black Atlantic Research at the University of Central Lancashire. Led by Dr Nicole Willson, the project seeks to excavate stories of women in the Haitian Revolution. Spanning a 100-year trajectory, from 1750-1850, it broadens the conventional scope of the Haitian revolutionary calendar to encompass the radical acts of female insurgency and marronage that predate the Ogé Rebellion of 1790 and the insurgency of 1791, and extends beyond the birth of the Haitian Republic in 1804 to encompass the life cycle of Marie-Louise Christophe, first Queen of Haiti. It explores narratives of resistance articulated through spiritual practice, domestic labour, creativity, survival, subterfuge and armed combat. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LMpLUlPQ2O950R3p4myxkDTtIuFwBOi-vJ7sTL6XhIoAKyPL4_r0BZVLbqVASWQSRP0Ah3JyZsskqOaSyV8Jrxr3K3lJ3G_OPtSMF15Xb-7eyfYC7tXl8vP73EULCd5TpC8IzHofCy8tfrfaZ4-nBg)

**Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America (United States, Race, Society, Housing, 20th Century)** Among the thousands of area descriptions created by agents of the federal government's Home Owners' Loan Corporation between 1935 and 1940, the one that was written for what is now called the Carver Heights neighborhood in Savannah, Georgia, stands out. HOLC staff members, using data and evaluations organized by local real estate professionals--lenders, developers, and real estate appraisers--in each city, assigned grades to residential neighborhoods that reflected their "mortgage security" that would then be visualized on color-coded maps. Neighborhoods receiving the highest grade of "A"--colored green on the maps--were deemed minimal risks for banks and other mortgage lenders when they were determining who should receive loans and which areas in the city were safe investments. Those receiving the lowest grade of "D," colored red, were considered "hazardous." ...![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/odzKKI3UJXFV391Bs6BVB3D7OjXL1ygPIKuGWnb0_T8oPq02GOAsQrJD8C20DrJs2KWWInTTIJdldZqa73B9U5AJrMGJU0z4R3WsUDzRaw1v4xXm7-1ak2srWQYd3YJArpgtzmRiz_j0TwMbhLooyQ)

**“They Came on Waves of Ink: Pacific Northwest Maritime Trade at the Dawn of American Settlement, 1851–1861”** Sean Fraga: “How important was steam power to U.S. colonization of the Pacific Northwest? This article uses data from an archival handwritten ledger covering the Puget Sound Customs District’s first decade (1851–1861) to investigate the use of steam-powered maritime mobility by non-natives during initial American settlement. By tracking individual vessels into and out of Puget Sound, these data make it possible to examine historical vessel traffic at a much finer resolution than is available in published sources. Mapping and visualizing this data shows that settlers relied far more on sailing vessels than on steam-powered ones. Although steam power captured settlers’ imaginations, steam-powered vessels made up a relatively small portion of Puget Sound vessel traffic and served fewer ports over a smaller area than did sailing vessels. While the 1858 Fraser River gold rush significantly altered regional travel patterns, its lasting impact on Puget Sound’s merchant marine was a new flotilla of small, simple sailing vessels that operated largely within the Pacific Northwest’s sheltered waters. Ultimately, this project demonstrates the potential of digitally analyzing raw data from similar records to better understand the maritime dimensions of U.S. territorial expansion.” <https://seanfraga.com/wavesofink/> (Article Version: <https://crdh.rrchnm.org/essays/v03-03-mapping-commercial-currents/>)

**From Forest to Vineyards: The Changing Landscape in Brazil (#Brazil #EnvironmentalHistory #Maps #GIS #Immigration)** Beginning in the nineteenth century, southern Brazil experienced an increasingly rapid transformation of its forest ecosystems, particularly in regions occupied by the settlement of Italian and German Immigrants. Over the intervening years, native forests were replaced by agriculture (mono and polyculture), livestock, urban centers, reforestation with exotic trees, and fruit cultivation. Specifically with respect to fruit cultivation, there was a preference for viticulture, which is the main subject of our research. There are few studies about the patterns and processes of this transformation and their relation with socioeconomic and biophysical aspects. Traditionally, there is a lack of integration of multidisciplinary data that has holding back the possibility to understand such complex phenomena. Therefore, an integrated approach helps to bring into a relevant contextual analysis by combining data normally analyzed separately. This research is intended to understand the transformation of ecosystems by linking and spatially integrating data on ecosystem distribution and formation, with demographic, land use, and settlement history data on a regional scale.

**GSR-Global Sea Routes, A Historical Geodatabase of European Global Navigation, 1450-1900** The forms of globalisation of the early modern age were achieved through the construction of a network of maritime connections which formed the backbone of continuous, stable and increasingly intensive trade, which fuelled the start of the globalisation of goods, consumption and, in time, markets. “GSR-Global Sea Routes. A historical geodatabase of European global navigation (1500-1900)” is finalized to building a relational geospatial database aimed at the study and georeferenced representation of the routes of merchant navigation of European nations on a global scale. Its chronological coverage 1500-1900 extends over the long period of time characterised by the transition from sailing to steam navigation, and by the opening of new maritime routes, especially after the inauguration of the Suez Canal in 1869. Its purpose is a new understanding of: 1) the historical evolution of European commercial long-distance navigation in quantitative and comparative terms; 2) the historical evolution, in terms of voyage timing, of world maritime interconnectedness fostered by European transoceanic merchant enterprises 1500-1900; 3) the specifics of individual overseas merchant routes through their detailed digital georeferenced and chrono-dynamic cartographic reconstruction; 4) the real daily circumstances of overseas navigation, as inferred from the analysis of the ship logbooks of the main European merchant fleets, treating them not just in cliometric terms, but also as narrative frameworks. GSR focuses on European long-distance navigation in the perspective tobinvestigate a particular dimension of ‘global Europeanness’, an expressionbdesignating the European projection onto a global level through sea shipping.nPositioning itself between global history, spatial history and digital history, GSR exploits first-hand sources making them “speak” both in descriptive terms and by way of cutting-edge GIS digital technologies for route construction and visualisatio. <https://www.openstarts.units.it/handle/10077/28201>

**Climatological Database for the World's Oceans (CLIWOC) (Environmental history, maritime history)** funded by the European Union, and pursued by a large team of researchers in organizations and universities around the world.  The database consists of 287,114 logbooks written aboard Dutch, English, French, and Spanish sailing ships. The vast majority of these logbooks date from between 1750 and 1850, yet four ship logbooks were incorporated that predate 1750. These were centuries of European imperial expansion, and so the logbooks record the activities of sailors - both civilian and military - in oceans that span the entire globe.  European sailors started writing daily logs in the sixteenth century, as they began to regularly leave familiar shores. One reason was that the leaders of increasingly bureaucratized admiralties and merchant companies wished to evaluate the performance of their officers. A more important reason had to do with the limits of contemporary navigation. From the mid-seventeenth century, sailors could determine latitude with reasonable accuracy even while far from coastal landmarks. Yet until the eighteenth-century invention, and the widespread nineteenth-century implementation, of the marine chronometer, they could only estimate longitude using “dead reckoning.” Dead reckoning was a technique that required knowledge of three essential variables: a ship’s speed, measured by log line; its course, determined by compass; and any drift by the ship from its course. That last variable responded primarily to the direction and velocity of the wind. To have even a rough sense of where they were, sailors needed to obsessively keep track of the wind. Most ship logbooks therefore abound with reliable, detailed, and almost unbroken weather observations that sailors wrote down whenever the wind changed. That makes them priceless sources for graphing and mapping past climate changes, particularly as they unfolded at sea - where researchers often have fragmentary or low resolution evidence. Moreover, they are unique - and uniquely underused - sources for connecting weather events and climate trends to human history. <http://www.historicalclimatology.com/cliwoc.html>

**Stolen (Conquest of Mexico, 16th Century)** An indigenous narrator explores the triumphs, downfall, and history of the Aztec civilization. Collection items from the Library of Congress such as Meso American codices, images, and audio highlight the rise and fall of the Aztecs. From the year 1325 to 1519, the Mexica, popularly known as the Aztecs- relied on the titlantlis, a Nahuatl word that means "messenger" to deliver important messages swiftly across their empire. In 1519, the titlantlis delivered a message that would forever change the course of their civilization- the arrival of the Spanish. This digital story map titled Stolen: An Indigenous Story of Conquest that presents the account of Titlantli, an omnipresent narrator and once an inhabitant of the great Aztec Capital of Tenochtitlán. Join Titlanti as she gives witness to her ancestors’ past, opens new historical perspectives, and speaks from Aztec civilization before, during, and after their conquest. <https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=000d139202c04f2dbf9a3c21afd36097>

**British Slave-owners Database** “The Centre is building on two earlier phases of work by the LBS team on British slave-ownership, which worked backwards from the end of slavery to trace the development of British colonial slavery. In 1833 Parliament finally abolished slavery in the British Caribbean, Mauritius and the Cape. The slave trade had been abolished in 1807, but it had taken another 26 years to effect the emancipation of the enslaved. However, in place of slavery the negotiated settlement established a system of apprenticeship, tying the newly freed men and women into another form of unfree labour for fixed terms. It also granted £20 million in compensation, to be paid by British taxpayers to the former slave-owners. That compensation money provided the starting point for our first project. In the second phase, we tracked back to c. 1763 the ownership histories of the 4000 or so estates identified in the first phase. In doing so, we doubled the number of estates identified and added another 20,000 slave-owners. By its nature the second phase will never be truly complete, and we continue to add to our data and publish new findings under the Centre.

**Rowley Soviet Ephemera Collection (Soviet Union / Russian History, 20th Century)** The Rowley Soviet Ephemera Collection, curated by Professor Alison Rowley, explores aspects of early Soviet history that are reflected in mass media, with a special emphasis on the shifting representations of women and cultural symbols of power and society. The collection spans the period from 1899 through the end of World War II and comprises 470 items, including 247 stamps, 49 periodicals, 46 postcards, 39 photographs, 30 sheet music pieces, and a number of newspapers, posters, books, booklets, and documents. Of special interest are visually rich Soviet magazines, including Zhenskii Zhurnal (Women’s Magazine), Rabotnitsa i Krest’ianka (The Female Worker and Peasant), and Fizkul’tura i Sport (Fitness and Sport), which reflect the changing role of women in Soviet society from 1927 through the late 1940s. Some of the collection’s materials promote immediate technological and economic concerns, like the rapid industrialization of the 1920s–1940s (Pesni Sovetskikh Zheleznodorozhnikov (Songs of the Soviet Train Workers)) or reinvestment into the Soviet economy (lottery tickets). Others focus on social and lifestyle matters: Magazines like Bezbozhnik (Without a God) served to reinforce the belief in the one-and-only Soviet state. Stamps connected the Soviet worker to distant frontiers, and presented an image of a strong and resilient Soviet citizen to the Western world. As diverse as it is visually stunning, this collection offers an incredible window into the idealized state that never quite caught up to its ambitions. <http://www.blavatnikarchive.org/collection/rowley>

**Foreign-Born Population: A Nation of Overlapping Diasporas (Immigration, US, 1850-2010)** “At all points in its history, a significant proportion of the population of the United States had been born in other countries and regions. This being the case, American history can never be understood by just looking within its borders. The culture and politics of the US have always been profoundly shaped by the material and emotional ties many of its residents have had to the places where they were born. This map will allow you to begin to explore those connections at the basic level of demographic statistics.”  <https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/foreignborn/#decade=2010>

**Historical Archives of Goa Medical Licensing Database, 1594-1748 (#Medical #HistoryOfMedicine #India #PortugueseEmpire #PortugueseIndia #Goa #Catholic #SouthAsia)**

“The Historical Archives of Goa Medical Licensing Database, 1596-1748 is a database of medical licensing records issued in Goa, the capital of the Portuguese Estado da Índia during the first several centuries of colonial rule. The database comprises 1,141 unique medical licensing documents containing mentions of 1,239 medical practitioners. All archival documents cited in the database come from records held in the Historical Archives of Goa (HAG), the state archive of Goa based in Panaji. The archive, which was founded in 1595 under Viceroy Matias de Albuquerque (1547-1609) and the first appointed archivist and chronicler, Diogo de Couto (1542/43-1616), contains an invaluable collection of municipal records from the Senado de Goa or Goan Municipal Council, including thousands of medical licensing records. The database described here contains only records from the first 150 years of extant medical licensing records, leaving space for future researchers to expand and improve the database to include later records.

**History Lab: Making Maps of Mexico (Maps, Censuses, Mexico, 19th Century)**  an experiment in collective, collaborative research and learning that took place at Johns Hopkins University in Spring 2021. The course was designed to help students learn something about Mexican history in the nineteenth century and something about the basics of qualitative data management and map making. The course was based around a set of agricultural surveys conducted across Mexico in 1899. We used the spreadsheets municipal officials filled out to think about the history of data, the history of life in rural Mexico, and the potential and the problems inherent in digital humanities. The class's work is part of Prof. Casey Lurtz's ongoing digital agricultural atlas project that aims to make this historical data widely available to scholars in an interactive, online format. Through the data cleaning, mapmaking, story telling, and conversations we had in this class, we thought through some of the challenges building such an interface poses.

**Interactive Atlas: Mapping Ethnicity (1960s-2010)** Prof. Marvin designed this app for the exclusive use of his students. The app allows users to explore the minority and majority ethnic groups that exist within and across political borders. What do various groups call themselves? What is their primary religion and language, and how do these correspond (or not) to the "official" and "majority" religions/languages that exist in the modern nation-states they find themselves living within? Are there current locations consequences of empire-building? A note on the data: the layer marked “1964 Ethnic Groups” is derived from: Weidmann, Nils B., Jan Ketil Rød, and Lars-Erik Cederman. “Representing Ethnic Groups in Space: A New Dataset.” Journal of Peace Research 47, no. 4 (2010): 491–99. The authors of this study chose to use the detailed, well-researched Atlas Narodov Mira (ANM, Bruk & Apenchenko, 1964), based on the work of Soviet ethnographers in the 1960s. The layer marked “2000s Ethnic Groups” is derived from 2010 data gathered by the Joshua Project, a Christian organization based in Colorado Springs (http&#x3A;//www.joshuaproject.net/).

**Mapping Globalization: Past, Present, and Future** Prof. Marvin designed this app for the exclusive use of his students. It helps users visualize globalization, the process by which the world has become more interconnected and more interdependent. The layers here represent global infrastructure networks, virtually all of which involve human interventions in the natural environment.These networks facilitate the movements of people, goods, and information across vast spaces. They have also accelerated the global spread of diseases, like Covid-19. Although these data mostly depict networks that exist at our present moment, I include a "walkthrough" demonstrating how each built on earlier versions discussed in the course. These apps were designed using ArcGIS Pro software. They incorporate open-source data.

**Bibliography of Historians’ Responses to Covid-19.** As the novel coronavirus began to spread in the United States, people across the country turned to historians for crucial insights regarding the history of epidemics and pandemics. From the Black Death in the 14th century to the 1918 flu, historians have drawn from a wealth of historical material to illustrate the range of human, governmental, societal, and scientific responses to massive disease outbreaks over time. As the COVID-19 crisis continued to unfold, historians were quick to assess the economic, political, and social fallout from the pandemic as it took its devastating toll on American life. The American Historical Association is compiling a professionally vetted bibliography of historians’ responses to COVID-19 as a resource for the public, teachers, and scholars seeking historical perspectives on the current crisis and its local and global impacts.

The bibliography includes commentary and publications by historians in both scholarly and popular periodical literature; recorded lectures and webcasts; and digitized primary source materials from past epidemics and pandemics. In amassing these references, the AHA seeks to provide a space where anyone, regardless of expertise, can find digital historical material relevant to the COVID-19 crisis. Educators will find the bibliography especially useful as a professionally vetted index of online resources amenable to remote instruction.

**“Slaves and the Courts, 1740 to 1860” (United States, Library of Congress Resource)** "This collection consists of 105 library books and manuscripts, totalling approximately 8,700 pages drawn principally from the Law Library and the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress, with a few from the General Collections. The selection was guided in large part by the entries in Slavery in the Courtroom: An Annotated Bibliography of American Cases by Paul Finkelman (Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress, 1985), which was based on research in the Library collections. The documents comprise an assortment of trials and cases, reports, arguments, accounts, examinations of cases and decisions, proceedings, journals, a letter, and other works of historical importance. Most of the items date from the nineteenth century and include materials associated with the Dred Scott case and the abolitionist activities of John Brown, John Quincy Adams, and William Lloyd Garrison. Eighteenth-century cases include Somerset v. Stewart, decided in England a few years before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which "underscored the great tension created by slavery in Anglo-American law." (Finkelman, p. 6) Some of the items presented here, such as the report of the trial of Castner Hanway in 1851, are the only primary source on their subjects. All but one of the items are available both as online images and as searchable text; the exception is an unpublished handwritten slavery code for the District of Columbia, which is available as images only.

Since the 2004 efforts of Brown University and the University of Alabama, a number of universities and colleges, including Universities Studying Slavery (USS) consortium members, have systematically engaged with researching and reconciling their institutional ties to slavery and its legacies. A growing number of these institutions have also developed digital repositories of their efforts. These digital humanities projects have proved instrumental for providing the necessary tools for engagement, demonstrating the transparency of the reconciliation work, connecting enslaved laborers’ descendants with the current campus communities, and encouraging difficult conversations reflective of the racially inclusive and diverse campuses. Of the existing digital humanities campus history projects, the Georgetown Slavery Archive is an exemplar for its democratization of the archives and for involving African American descendants in the campus reconciliation efforts. Created in 2016, this digital humanities project offers a model for institutions embarking on similar projects. At the core of this Omeka-supported digital humanities campus history project are the documents surrounding the 1838 sale of 272 enslaved men, women, and children (the so-called GU272, an identification number Georgetown uses to refer to this specific sale) by the president of Georgetown, the nature of slavery practiced on plantations owned by the Maryland Jesuits and at Georgetown University before and after the 1838 sale, and the post-sale fates of enslaved individuals in Louisiana and their descendants. These documents are centrally placed under the “Items” tab. As a repository of materials, the Georgetown Slavery Archive encourages individuals to explore these items before the other tabs. At present, the over 380 documents featured have clear titles and general descriptions contextualizing the items; the records list the creators of the documents and identify other source publication details. Some digital files are provided without correction, but there are also searchable transcriptions provided for handwritten sources. Documents are arranged both by identifier number and alternatively on an inventory timeline based on the creation date. The latter allows for individuals to easily locate documents produced during specific time periods. The home page also draws attention to all recent additions to this section.

This digital humanities project does not merely include traditional documents associated with the white Jesuit and university participants in the institution of slavery, such as bills of sale, inventories, newspaper advertisements, invoices, and playbills for antebellum campus performances of minstrel shows. Rather, the site fully incorporates sources demonstrating the enslaved and post-emancipation experiences of African Americans and their descendants, such as court testimonies, photographs, obituaries, oral histories, biographical profiles, ephemera, and multimedia recordings. By including these rich African American archival sources, the site moves beyond documenting the victimization of the enslaved campus laborers and beyond the promotion of a self-congratulatory narrative of Georgetown University embracing its slave past. This inclusion reveals a fuller and more nuanced narrative of how both white and African American historical actors navigated the racial geographies created by the institution of slavery at the Maryland Jesuit plantations and at the Georgetown University campus, and how they navigated the legacies of slavery for the affected communities. In addition to primary sources, the inventory includes relevant secondary sources, specifically book chapters and articles.

By privileging these basic building blocks immediately following the home page, the site encourages different levels of engagement and contemporary conversations from academics, current campus faculty, students, and administrators, and African American descendants. Moreover, the placement and content of the “Items” tab demonstrate the vision of the Archives Subgroup of the Georgetown University Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation and the fulfillment of a suggested recommendation of the broader Georgetown University Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation initiative (the full report can be found on the website). It also highlights the role of education as an essential component in finding inclusive and sustainable community-based solutions to current debates over the memory of slavery and its legacy. The “Collections” section of the Georgetown Slavery Archive provides a manageable, accessible, and well-organized way to navigate historical documents contained in the items inventory. The six collections bridge the past with the present. The collections are “Memory and Reconciliation,” “Descendants’ Stories,” “The Maryland Province Slaves in Louisiana, and Their Descendants,” “Slavery at Georgetown College,” “Slavery in the Maryland Province,” and “Sale of Maryland Jesuit Slaves to Louisiana in 1838”; the latter collections contain current discussions of memory, reconciliation, and reparations. Again, the order of the digitized collections demonstrates the larger reconciliation aims for sustaining dialogues between the institution, the current campus community, and African American descendants. Rather than privilege the enslavers’ voices and perspectives, the “Memory and Reconciliation” and “Descendants’ Stories” collections are listed first. Although individuals can opt to ignore these collections, their placement reverses a common historical and current experience of African Americans forced to navigate a commemorative campus landscape of the enslavers and a broader regional commemorative landscape defined by the United Daughters of the Confederacy’s Lost Cause memorial projects. The subtle subversion of historical power hierarchies signals that the reconciliation efforts are not mere lip service to the GU272 and other African American descendants of former enslaved campus laborers. Here, the designers of the repository brilliantly display their scholarly understanding of the need to overcome the previous silences of the archives designed for the study of the enslavers and white elites; this also stands as an example of the archival democratization possibilities afforded by the digital humanities, as argued by Moya Bailey, Tara McPherson, Vincent Brown, and Jessica Marie Johnson. (For specific readings, see Bailey, “All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave,” Journal of Digital Humanities 1, no. 1 \[2011]; McPherson, “Why Are the Digital Humanities So White? Or, Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation,” in Matthew K. Gold, ed., Debates in the Digital Humanities \[2012], 139–160; Brown, “Mapping a Slave Revolt: Visualizing Spatial History through the Archives of Slavery,” Social Text 33, no. 4 \[2015]: 134–141; and Johnson, “Markup Bodies: Black \[Life] Studies and Slavery \[Death] Studies at the Digital Crossroads,” Social Text 36, no. 4 \[2018]: 57–79.)

These archival democratization and reconciliation aims are further extended in the “Descendants” section. The page provides a historical account of the university’s efforts to locate and involve descendants. The simple text page includes the names and contact information for staff at Georgetown working to trace the descendants of those enslaved by the institution. More importantly, it offers a simple genealogical guide for individuals seeking information on their possible connection to the GU272. While focused on the GU272, this guide can be employed by others attempting African American genealogy prior to abolition and emancipation. As an ongoing project, this section on the site would be strengthened by the inclusion of links to the GU272 Descendants Association website and research on African American descendants of the unsold campus laborers. The remaining sections showcase student research and possible further research directions. Using student-created podcasts and videos, the “Multimedia” section features Georgetown University students as both the creators of knowledge and important participants in the overall campus reconciliation efforts. Although featuring only a limited number of items and lacking contextualizing editorial content, the “Gallery” section is a curated selection of primary sources that might be incorporated in teaching and student assignments at the K-12 and collegiate levels. The “Map” section allows for a geospatial analysis of the archives and reinforces the consequences of the 1838 sale for both the university and the individuals sold to Louisiana. Similar to the “Gallery” section, more guidance on usage would allow for expanded incorporation into classroom teaching. Lastly, the “Further Readings” section offers a simple bibliography of secondary sources that will help deepen understanding of the archival material and guide further exploration of the historical topics presented. The Georgetown Slavery Archive is a valuable digital humanities project. While it reflects the interests of current Georgetown University stakeholders, this free and visually appealing open-access site provides a model for other institutions doing comparable work. It equips diverse communities engaged in the current debates over slavery and memory with necessary digital tools and scholarly expertise, and it promotes community-based solutions to current debates over slavery and memory. It also encourages future research by academics, descendants, and the broader public while facilitating ongoing campus reconciliation efforts. The inclusive and democratic vision undergirding the Georgetown Slavery Archive is worthy of replication. © The Author 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

REVIEW: MARRONNAGE IN SAINT-DOMINGUE (HAÏTI) <http://www.marronnage.info/en/>

Marronnage in Saint-Domingue (Haïti) <http://www.marronnage.info/en/>

The American Historical Review, Volume 125, Issue 2, April 2020, Pages 581–583, <https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/rhz664>

Issue Section: [Digital History Reviews](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/search-results?f_TocHeadingTitle=Digital%20History%20Reviews)

Launched by the French Atlantic History Group some ten years ago, under the direction of Jean-Paul Le Glaunec and Léon Robichaud, the website Marronnage in Saint-Domingue (Haïti) is devoted to the study of fugitive slaves in the eighteenth-century Caribbean’s most important colony. (Derived from the Spanish cimarronaje, the spellings marronnage and marronage are used in French; “marronage” and “maroonage” are used in English. The term covers the identity and activities of runaway slaves.) In the last year, the site has been undergoing major expansion. At the time of writing (and of publication), the project remains incomplete and several parts of site have become inaccessible. What follows, therefore, is a slightly anachronistic review of a work in progress. (Those with a proficiency in French may have better luck visiting the French-language side of the site, which has increased accessibility at time of publication.)

Historians of slavery in the Americas have long been drawn to the advertisements for escaped slaves that their owners placed in local newspapers. They have proved a rich source for analysis. Besides documenting one of the most widespread types of resistance to enslavement, they often contain details about the physical appearance of enslaved persons (height, bodily markings and injuries, dentition, clothing), their language skills and manner of talking, supposed personality traits, and social contacts. In no other type of document do so many of the enslaved appear as distinct individuals. Although property records par excellence, couched in the slave owner’s usually disdainful language, such advertisements offer rare glimpses of the slave’s humanity. For much of the eighteenth century, the French colony of Saint-Domingue was Europe’s main source of tropical produce. On the eve of its destruction during the Haitian Revolution, it contained the third largest slave population in the Americas and rivaled Brazil as the principal destination of the Atlantic slave trade. The colony’s slavery records are particularly valuable because of their unusual degree of specificity regarding the ethnic origins of African-born captives, who constituted more than half of the colony’s enslaved workers. The local newspaper, Les Affiches Américaines, is the website’s sole source of Saint-Domingue material, and following the website’s expansion in scope, this newspaper remains its principal source of material. The Affiches ran from 1766 to 1791, and one fairly complete collection exists in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, in Paris. It is not quite as inaccessible a resource as the website’s directors seem to believe; the University of Florida had the collection microfilmed in 1993, and that microfilm was later digitized and made available online by the Law Library Microform Consortium (today LLMC Digital) and subsequently by the Digital Library of the Caribbean.

The fugitive slave material is also nowhere near as neglected as the website claims. To judge from the (currently closed) bibliography that the site hosted, the site’s organizers were unaware of some of the most relevant Saint-Domingue scholarship of the previous twenty-five years. Nevertheless, though they greatly exaggerate in claiming the maroon advertisements in the Affiches as “unexplored,” the website represents a great step forward for the history of both maroonage and Saint-Domingue. It presents an unusually large dataset in a stylishly designed format that allows for easy interrogation. A strong feature of the site is that it provides a photo of each individual document in JPEG form alongside a machine-readable transcription. This enhances the project’s aesthetic appeal and preserves some of the feel of working with the original paper while permitting high-speed content analysis. Versions of the site in English and French are available, although the primary sources themselves are not translated.

For most of the website’s history it has displayed only advertisements for missing slaves. Now a second type of document is being added: jail lists of recaptured fugitives. There are 6,535 lists and 10,772 adverts, but as the lists contain many more names than the adverts, this addition represents a big expansion in the corpus of fugitives. It should also illustrate, through comparison of the missing and recaptured, the differential success in maroonage of different segments of the enslaved population. Historians have rarely investigated the issue, as jail lists seem to be unique to the French colonies. The site provides a search tool that includes filters for type of document, year, newspaper, and slaves’ names and sexes. Different criteria can be combined and, as all words in the transcribed documents can be searched, the potential field of inquiry is very broad. Its ease of use, for those with enough French, makes it suitable for undergraduate projects, as well for more extensive research.

Another way in which the Saint-Domingue material might be expanded would be to add the issues of Les Affiches Américaines’ two predecessors, Gazette de Saint-Domingue and Avis Divers et Petites Affiches Américaines, which were published in 1764–1765 and are accessible online at LLMC Digital and at the Digital Library of the Caribbean. Similarly, the many rivals and successors of the Affiches that sprang up in the period from 1790 to 1793 could provide more data, albeit at the risk of duplicating material that appeared in different newspapers. Finally, as the Bibliothèque Nationale’s collection of the Affiches Américaines contains gaps (a few of which at least can be filled by isolated copies held by other institutions, such as Harvard University, the John Carter Brown Library, etc.), one hopes they will be eventually added to the database. Meanwhile, the Marronnage in Saint-Domingue website has embarked on a different sort of expansion. After integrating similar material from newspapers in Guadeloupe (1815–1833), Guyane (1829), Jamaica (1800–1815), Louisiana (1801–1815), Lower Canada (1765–1810), and South Carolina (1802–1815), the site will become Marronnage in the Atlantic World: Sources and Life Trajectories. These additions bring the total number of advertisements to 15,638 and that of jail lists to 6,846. The figure currently given for the total number of slaves identified, 22,638, seems to be an error and presumably concerns only the advertisements. These ads usually mentioned only one slave, and occasionally a few, whereas jail lists were generally longer—and sometimes much longer. The total number of fugitives recorded therefore must be much higher. The relationship between the number of slaves who escaped in a given year and the number of those mentioned in the press is highly uncertain. The newspaper adverts inflate the phenomenon somewhat, because slave owners sometimes paid to have the same ad repeated in successive issues of a newspaper. (Les Affiches Américaines marked such duplicate advertisements, but the website does not.) On the other hand, most fugitives probably never became the subject of an advertisement, especially if they were captured (or returned) quickly, or if their owner lived far from the newspaper’s place of publication. Similarly, not all recaptured maroons passed via a jail. Plantation accounts and correspondence can help with these issues somewhat; they therefore form a vital complement to the newspaper data in maroonage research. The newspaper press, however, provides the best overview of slave desertion in a particular locale, which is why this website is such a valuable resource. Even after the website’s recent extension in geographical range, Saint-Domingue continues to dominate the project, but the scope for further expansion of this sort is considerable.

The Slave Societies Digital Archive

<https://www.slavesocieties.org/>

Elena A. Schneider. Reviewed in The American Historical Review, Volume 125, Issue 2, April 2020, Pages 579–581, <https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/rhz750>: The Slave Societies Digital Archive (SSDA) is one of the longest-running digital projects on the history of Africans and their descendants in the Atlantic World. Formerly known as Ecclesiastical and Secular Sources for Slave Societies, the digital project was launched in 2003 as an NEH-funded collaboration between Jane Landers of Vanderbilt University, Mariza de Carvalho Soares of Universidade Federal Fluminense, and Paul E. Lovejoy of York University. It arrived on the web shortly after Gwendolyn Midlo Hall’s Louisiana Slave Database and the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (today Slave Voyages) initiated by David Richardson and David Eltis. Unlike these other digital history projects, though, from the beginning SSDA’s core mission has been archival preservation. Landers and her team have focused their resources and energy on identifying, cataloguing, and digitally preserving endangered archival materials located in local parishes in formerly slaveholding societies in Latin America and the Caribbean. The scope of this sixteen-year project is vast. The digital archive now holds approximately seven hundred thousand images of written documents dating from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, with a focus on Brazil, Cuba, Colombia, and Spanish Florida. Its earliest sources hail from Cuba and Spanish Florida in the 1590s, and its most recent ones date from the end of slavery in Brazil in 1888. According to its creators, in total the SSDA records the lives of approximately six million free and enslaved Africans and their descendants, along with the indigenous, European, and Asian populations with whom they interacted. What the SSDA has preserved is a treasure trove of material stored primarily in Catholic Church records about the lives and social worlds of Africans and their descendants in the Americas. These sources include baptismal records, wills, marriage certificates, burial records, and sometimes even records of annulments—documents that allow scholars to explore the African identities of diasporic populations and the social, political, and economic networks Africans and their descendants constructed in the Americas. Baptismal records usually list the name, age cohort, African “nation” or ethnicity of the person baptized, their parents (if known), their owner (if enslaved), and the profiles of any godparents participating in the ceremony. Marriage records, in turn, marked down names and “nations” of brides, grooms, their sponsors (often referred to as godparents), and witnesses. Taken together with wills and other secular documents collected by the SSDA, these materials offer an unparalleled view of African “personhood” and community social life in American slave societies. They also provide a powerful counterpoint to the abundant but violently reductive commercial records produced by the transatlantic slave trade and slaveholders’ bookkeeping practices in plantation societies….

**African Origins**

<http://www.african-origins.org/> 

African Origins contains information about the migration histories of Africans forcibly carried on slave ships into the Atlantic. Using the personal details of 91,491 Africans liberated by International Courts of Mixed Commission and British Vice Admiralty Courts, this resource makes possible new geographic, ethnic, and linguistic data on peoples captured in Africa and pulled into the slave trade. The African Origins project arose directly from the work of G. Ugo Nwokeji and David Eltis, who in 2002 used audio recordings of names found in Courts of Mixed Commission records for Havana, Cuba, and Freetown, Sierra Leone, to identify likely ethno-linguistic origins. The names in these recordings were pronounced by speakers of the same language and accent that the Courts of Mixed Commission registrars would likely have had (e.g., if the name was written in a Havana register, Eltis and Nwokeji had the name pronounced by a Spanish speaker with a Havana accent). This helped connect the sound of the name to its spelling and thus enabled a more accurate assessment of the name’s possible ethnic origins than provided by its written counterpart alone. Those with knowledge of African languages, cultural naming practices, and ethnic groups can assist in identifying these Africans' origins by drawing on their own expertise to identify the likely ethno-linguistic origin of an individual's name.

Georgian Papers Programme (Early Modern England, British Empire, Georgian Monarchy) “One of the world’s venerable institutions, the British Crown, through the Georgian Papers Programme, is leading in innovative approaches to digitising, promoting and opening up precious archives from the iconic 12th-century round tower of Windsor Castle. … The Georgian papers, 1714-1837, come to us from the threshold of modern history when science, exploration and trade created new, dynamic global connections with transformative consequences. The Georgian Papers Programme explores the fully global dimensions of the period. … The Georgian papers, a unique and multi-faceted archive, is expanding scholarly exchange across disciplines, generations and among universities, archivists and librarians and researchers beyond the academy, its new discoveries, perspectives and innovative approaches–creating an important new hub for 18th-century studies.  Scholarly and public events share these discoveries and new knowledge more broadly.”

The Durham Consistory Court Cause Papers (Early Modern England)

The Durham Consistory Court Cause Papers are great for a bit of local gossip and scandal from the 17th and 18th centuries. Defamation cases, bartering for a pew in church, matrimonial disputes are all in there.

**Lapham’s Quarterly** “Lapham’s Quarterly embodies the belief that history is the root of all education, scientific and literary as well as political and economic. Each issue addresses a topic of current interest and concern—war, religion, money, medicine, nature, crime—by bringing up to the microphone of the present the advice and counsel of the past.”

**Not Even Past** Not Even Past is a digital magazine that serves as a robust platform for Public History with a global reach. It was founded in 2010 and developed by the Department of History at the University of Texas at Austin. It is read by around half a million users each year. The site has three main goals. Not Even Past aims, first, to bring great History writing to the public. The faculty and graduate students in the Department of History are committed to making our research freely accessible to anyone interested in History and Not Even Past provides a key vehicle for this. Second, the site serves as a reliable and frequently updated resource for History online. We publish extended research features, book recommendations, reviews of historical films and digital archives, teaching and course profiles, and stories that shed light on intriguing corners of the past. Although much of our content comes from scholars associated with the University of Texas at Austin, we also publish the work of academics and students from different institutions across the world. Third, Not Even Past provides a way for past graduates and supporters of the History program to stay in contact with the department and the full range of its activities.

**The History News Network** (HNN). Our mission is to help put current events into historical perspective. Given how public opinion is shaped today, whipsawed emotionally on talk shows this way and that in response to the egos of the guests, the desire for ratings by the hosts and the search for profits by media companies and sponsors, historians are especially needed now. They can help remind us of the superficiality of what-happens-today-is-all-that-counts journalism. Each week HNN features up to a dozen fresh op eds by prominent historians. Our archives, extending over the past decade, include thousands of well-researched pieces. Even those who profess utter indifference to history are beholden to it. History is inescapable. Who we are and how we react to events depends, to a great extent, on our past. As Eugene O'Neill has a character in Long Day's Journey into Night exclaim, at a critical juncture,"The past is the present, isn't it? It's the future, too. We all try to lie out of that but life won't let us." Our motto at HNN reflects O'Neill's insight:"History News Network ... Because the past is the present, and the future, too." Journalism is said to be the first draft of history. But journalists traditionally have had little use for historians. The list of occasions on which journalists feel compelled to call upon historians is short. Though a select number of historians recently have become media stars, the fact remains that few are publicly quoted, and hardly any are given the public platform regularly awarded economists, political scientists or pollsters. The last historian trusted to take a large and visible role in a national administration was Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and that was some fifty years ago. Among the many duties we assume are these: To expose politicians who misrepresent history. To point out bogus analogies. To deflate beguiling myths. To remind Americans of the irony of history. To put events in context. To remind us all of the complexity of history. Because we believe history is complicated our pages are open to people of all political persuasions. Left, right, center: all are welcome.

**Global Architectural History Teaching Collective (MIT): Lectures, Slides Bank, other Resources**

“The ambition of the GAHTC is to address the needs of educators in diverse disciplinary contexts by providing practical lecture materials for teaching global architectural history at the survey and introductory level. This effort does not preclude more advanced level education, but the main purpose of the GAHTC is to transform the discipline 'from below'—to help guide the discourse of architectural history by reshaping its teaching at the survey level. Instead of waiting for advanced scholarship to trickle down into the realm of teaching, which is the usual expectation, we want to empower the teachers — particularly those at institutions where teachers are given fewer teaching resources — to be part of a state-of-the-art teaching community. Teaching materials produced by our members for GAHTC emphasize transnational and trans-geographical perspectives, providing alternatives to architectural and art history courses organized by nation-based or style-based categories such as ‘Italian', 'French', 'Chinese' and 'The Renaissance'.”

**Mapping Islamophobia in the United States**

Grinnell College: “We are working our way back in time, beginning with the current moment and eventually ending in late 2001. Given the incredible rise in Islamophobic events over the past two years we decided to make the map public well before work is complete. Work is ongoing. Ours is by no means an exhaustive accounting of Islamophobic incidents and events nor American Muslim participation in public life. We have consciously limited entries to those that we can source with confidence. Many, many–if not a majority–of everyday instances of Islamophobia go unreported. We dedicate this project to all those who suffer the effects of Islamophobia, particularly those who do so in silence, and to American Muslims dedicating their lives to making our communities the best they can be.” <https://mappingislamophobia.org/about/>

**Good-Lands**  “A fundamental way to address many of the issues we confront as a society today is to use the land and properties we already “have more thoughtfully. GoodLands provides the information, insights, and implementation tools for the Catholic Church to leverage its landholdings to address pressing issues, from environmental destruction to mass human migration. We combine community involvement, design, and mapping technology to reveal high-impact opportunities for land-use strategies that have a regenerative impact on environmental, social, and economic systems while transforming a sense of ownership of land into a sense of stewardship amongst organizations through top-down planning efforts combined with bottom-up community involvement and education.” ****<https://good-lands.org/>

**PaperMonuments** Paper Monuments was a public art and public history project designed to elevate the voices of the people of New Orleans, as a critical process towards creating new narratives and symbols of our city that represent our collective vision, and to honor the erased histories of the people, places, movements, and events that have made up the past 300 years as we look to the future. ****<https://www.papermonuments.org/>

**New Public: For Better Digital Public Spaces** An initiative that uses insights from urban planning to think about how to build digital spaces that do not monetize our social activity or spy on us for profit. Its founders maintain that our current social media landscape can't be solved by better technology or more advanced algorithms. The solution is low-tech, though challenging: social programming, run by real people. And who better to glean wisdom from than the people running parks and libraries, who have been managing these challenges in our physical world for decades? Director, Eric Pariser, mentions being inspired by a Memphis River Parks initiative aiming to bring black and white communities together in the same spaces <https://newpublic.org/>

We were formed after a national symposium in 2011. Leaders from the U.S. and Canada came together to discuss the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the need for such a process in the U.S. NABS was created to develop and implement a national strategy that increases public awareness and cultivates healing for the profound trauma experienced by individuals, families, communities, American Indian and Alaska Native Nations resulting from the U.S. adoption and implementation of the Boarding School Policy of 1869.”
